This is simple application of a sensor logging with a android smartphone. <br />
It detects Gravity, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer (These three are collected from the API Sensor Manager) <br />
and Location (collected from Location Manager).

Beside that you can start/stop logging, and its data are stored in a csv file with timestamp. You can download/export it. <br />

Hope you can enjoy, by any issues please contact me. This project was an exercise for newcomers at HARMAN. <br />
